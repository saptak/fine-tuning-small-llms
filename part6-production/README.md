# Part 6: Production, Monitoring, and Scaling

This directory contains enterprise-grade production tools for monitoring, scaling, security, and optimization of your fine-tuned LLM deployment.

## üéØ Features

- **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana with custom dashboards
- **Auto-Scaling**: Intelligent resource management and scaling policies
- **Security Framework**: Multi-layer authentication and protection
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, connection pooling, and resource optimization
- **Cost Management**: Usage analytics and cost optimization tools
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backups and restoration procedures

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash

./scripts/setup_monitoring.sh

# Deploy production stack
./scripts/production_deploy.sh

# Monitor performance
python src/performance_monitor.py

# Run cost analysis
python src/cost_optimizer.py --analyze
```
